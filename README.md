# RandomQuotes
Random  quotes generator that displays famous quotes from famous people on the screen
This project is the first project that was assigned to me by the treehouse Techdegree courses.
The project is based on a node.js server with express framework, and an external api from the https://talaikis.com.

Entering the site on the port:3000, will generate random quotes with authors name on the side.
